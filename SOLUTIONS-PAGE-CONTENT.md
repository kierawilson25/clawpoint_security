## Service Offerings

The page features three main service cards, each with an icon and detailed description:

---

### 1. Mission-Centric Assurance

**Icon:** Network/infrastructure diagram (green)

**Full Description:**

Compliance reframed as operational advantage. We turn frameworks into force multipliers—linking RMF/CSF/FedRAMP controls to real threats, real workflows, and real outcomes. Instead of paperwork for auditors, you get instruments for operators: control sets tied to attack paths, evidence pipelines that auto-collect from your stack, and metrics that track readiness the same way you track revenue. The result is assurance that moves with the mission—faster approvals, cleaner risk decisions, and controls that harden every day you use them.

**Key Features:**
- RMF/CSF/FedRAMP framework integration
- Control sets tied to attack paths
- Automated evidence pipelines
- Revenue-style readiness metrics
- Faster approvals and cleaner risk decisions

**Value Proposition:**
- Transforms compliance from paperwork to operational advantage
- Creates force multipliers from frameworks
- Links controls to real threats, workflows, and outcomes

### 2. Cyber Operations Design

**Icon:** Figure running on platform (green)

**Full Description:**

Build what matters. Lead what you design. We help you architect cyber programs that actually ship outcomes—operating models, playbooks, and automation that scale with your business. From intake and triage to incident response and recovery, we define crisp roles, measurable SLAs, and "detectors-to-decisions" workflows that reduce dwell time. Expect tight SIEM/SOAR integrations, purple-team feedback loops, and dashboards that turn KPIs into action. We'll coach your leaders to run the mission, not the fire drill—so your team owns the design and the results.

**Key Features:**
- Operating models and playbooks
- Scalable automation
- Crisp roles and measurable SLAs
- "Detectors-to-decisions" workflows
- SIEM/SOAR integrations
- Purple-team feedback loops
- Actionable KPI dashboards
- Leadership coaching

**Value Proposition:**
- Design cyber programs that deliver real outcomes
- Reduce dwell time from detection to action
- Enable teams to own both design and results
- Focus on mission, not fire drills

### 3. Security Architecture & Threat Intelligence

**Icon:** Empty card space (third service card)

Instead of swivel-chair hunting, analysts get a guided path from signal to story to action.
