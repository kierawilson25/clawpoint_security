## LIMITATIONS ENCOUNTERED

### Technical Challenge
The current website is built on **Wix**, which loads content dynamically via JavaScript. This prevented direct HTML parsing and required web search-based extraction.

### Content Quality
- **Confidence Level:** 80-85%
- **Source:** Web search results, metadata, and cached content
- **Gaps:** Specific form fields, exact button text, detailed navigation structure
